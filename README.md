# What is this?
The setup of this homework has taken longer than I would like, and I hope save others some time. This provides a dev environment ready to go through GitHub Codespace.

If you encounter any issue, comment on the Ed thread instead of making an issue on GitHub. 

This repo may be useful for making other CHIPS work, but I don't have time to do that yet.

This repository contains no solutions, only the setup to run Part 1 without errors. If this violates the academic honesty pledge, I will delete this repo immediately.

## 4.

The build is going to take a while. You can get up and stretch. Sorry I don't have enough time to setup CI and signing so I won't provide the Docker image.
